PLANCKS stands for Physics League Across Numerous Countries for Kick-ass Students and is an annual international physics contest for bachelor- and master students. Graz, Austria, is the venue of the 2017 tournament, which will be held from the 26th to the 29th May.

The event will span three days with the possibility of attaching a fourth “extra” day in order to get to know the host country better. A symposium, the competition itself, a scientific discussion, the closing ceremony and different social activities are part of this contest.
