# **Isn't this awesome?**

If this doesn't look right, you're probably trying to view this page without running `jekyll serve` first.

Oh, btw, code highlighting:

{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Materialize.css + Jekyll = <3");
  System.out.println("Crucible is okay too I guess.");
}
{% endhighlight %}
